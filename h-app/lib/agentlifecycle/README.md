# agentlifecycle

A library, not a port. Start/stop/pause/resume logic for an agent/participant:
writes registry/policy/HMAC-key desired state, and delegates the actual
mechanism (a tmux window, for now) to callbacks the caller supplies. Supports
`tmux` and `api` port types today; openshell support was removed until that
module actually exists in h-mesh.

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `lifecycle.py` | `start_agent`/`stop_agent`/`pause_agent`/`resume_agent`, callback-driven, no port of its own |
