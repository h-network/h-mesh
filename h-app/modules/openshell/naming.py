"""Name derivation for OpenShell resources.

Both sandbox names and workspace names are capped at 19 characters by the
real gateway — confirmed directly (`INVALID_ARGUMENT: name exceeds maximum
length (20 > 19)` for a sandbox, `(24 > 19)` for a workspace), not assumed
from documentation. Mesh agent names allow up to 63
(`SEGMENT_REGEX` in `core/keys.py`), and a `pod:tenant` pair can
easily exceed 19 too, so anything derived from either needs shortening.

The real (untruncated) name always belongs in a sandbox's `labels`
(`SandboxRef.labels`, which has no length limit observed) — this module
only produces the value OpenShell requires *as* `name`.
