"""Per-CLI headless (non-interactive) invocation, for one-shot exec delivery.

Mirrors `modules.tmux.ops.start_agent_command`, which builds the *interactive*
launch argv for a tmux pane, but for a CLI invoked once per delivered
message inside an OpenShell sandbox via `ExecSandbox` instead of a
persistent pane. `ExecSandbox` spawns a fresh process and returns on exit —
there is no "paste into a running process" equivalent — so continuity
across deliveries comes entirely from each CLI's own resume/continue flag
plus its on-disk session state persisting in the long-lived sandbox.

The message text itself is never interpolated into argv: it is always
carried on stdin, both to avoid shell-quoting/length limits and so
delivered text can never be read as a flag.

`claude` and `codex` argv below have been executed end-to-end against a
real OpenShell sandbox on the office's test gateway (2026-08-29): both
parse and run without argument errors, `claude -p`/`-p -c` fail cleanly on
"Not logged in" (expected — no credential was injected for this check, see
docs/LLD-port-openshell.md's credential-transfer rule), and `codex exec
--skip-git-repo-check resume --last -` was confirmed to actually resume the
session created by a prior `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -` call in
the same sandbox — real evidence that session continuity across separate
one-shot `exec()` invocations works the way this whole design assumes.

`--skip-git-repo-check` was not in the original inference from `--help`
alone and was only found necessary by actually running the command: codex
refuses to run in a directory it doesn't trust, and a fresh sandbox's
default workdir is not one. This is exactly why the module docstring used
to warn that help-text inference is weaker than an observed result — here
is a case where that gap was real.

`agy` remains an unverified placeholder — its `--print`/`--prompt` split
was ambiguous even in its own `--help`, and it isn't installed in the
default sandbox image at all (checked directly: `which agy` exits 1), so
there's nothing to run it against yet regardless.
