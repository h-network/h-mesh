"""Thin wrapper around the real NVIDIA OpenShell SDK (`openshell.SandboxClient`).

Verified against `openshell` 0.0.116 (`SandboxClient.create/get/delete/exec`,
`SandboxRef`, `ExecResult`) — see docs/LLD-port-openshell.md. There is
deliberately no fake-success fallback anywhere in this module: every method
either reaches the real gateway through the SDK or raises
`OpenShellUnavailable`. A prior attempt at this integration shipped a
default path that fabricated "running" / exit code 0 whenever the gateway
was unreachable, and its test suite only ever exercised an injected mock,
never that default path — this module and its tests are built specifically
not to repeat that.
