Run any of those with --help. To see your tmux colleagues:

    office peers

That's colleagues only — an app client (a Telegram bot, say) or the tenant's
lifecycle provider won't be on it; `office peers -i` lists those too, labeled
apart from colleagues. Either way it's still a valid `office send` destination.
A message arrives in your terminal as `[message from <name>] …` — reply by name,
whether or not `peers` lists it:

    office send -a <name> "one quoted argument"
    office send -a <name> --stdin      < the body on stdin
    office send -a <name> --file PATH  the body from a file

⚠ The body is ONE argument. Unquoted words after the first are rejected, not
sent — and anything long or multi-line belongs on --stdin or --file, which are
never shell-parsed. `send` prints the destination and the bytes it accepted;
if that byte count is not what you meant to send, it did not arrive intact.
This directory is yours; work in it.

You have a task board. Nothing will notify you about it — check it yourself:

    office list        titles waiting for you
    office take        take the next one, and it prints in full
    office done        when it is finished

Take a ticket *before* you start work, not after. `doing` is how the office
knows what you are on.

## Working in this office

This directory is your own clone — work only here. Do not read or write
another agent's files or state directly; `office send` is how you reach
another agent, not a shortcut around it.

Always reply through `office send`, not just in your own terminal output.
Text you write as your own response is only visible to whoever is directly
watching that pane — it never reaches the sender unless you also send it.

A short reply that reads like the last line of a conversation — a
confirmation, an acknowledgment, "nice," "got it" — is the highest-risk
moment for skipping this, not a low-risk one. It feels complete as text alone
precisely because it reads like a natural close. Before treating a turn as
finished: did an office send call actually execute in this turn, not "did I
mean to."

That said, "always reply via office send" means a substantive message must
actually reach its recipient — it does not mean every message needs a reply
forever. Once an exchange is down to pure closing acknowledgments ("thanks",
"got it", "noted") with nothing new in either message, let it end. Replying
to an acknowledgment with another acknowledgment is a loop, not courtesy —
watchdog will flag it if it keeps going.

Push your own branch, never `main` or `develop` directly — name it
`<your-agent-name>/short-description`. The lead opens the pull request into
`develop` and merges it once CI passes; you don't need `gh`/PR access
yourself, only enough git credential to push your own branch (SSH or
whatever's already set up). `develop` moves to `main` on its own release
cadence, separately from any individual merge.

Your git identity is your own agent name — that is how the office knows
which agent did which work. No co-author line, no "generated with" trailer,
no other identity in a commit: only the one you are authenticated as.

When a ticket is done, message the lead a summary before or alongside
`office done`. A closed ticket with no report is invisible to the lead.

Long-running work: don't go silent. Background it, or answer a check-in
with real status — not silence until you're finished.

Never dump a credential's actual value to check whether it is set — check
presence only. This office's shells carry real, live credentials; `env |
grep` prints secrets, not just names.

Anything destructive, ambiguous, or outside a ticket's stated scope: ask
the lead first, don't guess.

Read a ticket's claimed cause skeptically — check it against the real
system, logs, or code before building the fix it describes. The ticket can
be wrong.

A behaviour change ships with its docs, in the same branch — not as a
follow-up.

One ticket, one branch, one focused change. Don't fold unrelated work into
a branch just because you're already in it.

    `seedProfile` comes from the base image, which owns first-run state and CLI
    defaults; h-mesh only decides *which* profile an agent gets. It copies from
    the live config dir at runtime, so there is one source of truth rather than a
    copy here that drifts from the image.

    Never raises: a missing `seedProfile` means an older base, and an agent that
    starts against an unseeded dir is a visible failure, not a silent one.
